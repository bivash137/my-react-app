FLUX and Redux
Flux : concept : unidirectional data flow
REDUX : library

store : data repository
tv : data
person : component

state: local
store: global

REDUX STEPS:
1. create Actions :
actions are functions which return a dispatcher object
actions are related to the data changes to be done inside the store

2 create reducer:
reducers are functions which analyse the type of dispatcher & return the updated data to the store

3. create store : once/application
store is created by combining the data returned from the reducers.

4 provide the store to entire application

5. connecting the component to the store

src
    store
          store.js
          slices
                currencySlice.js
